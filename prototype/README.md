# Directions for Running Prototype

To run and test this milestone you will need to use this link to get to the blockly environment. The link being https://yallowman.github.io/TaskFlow/design-blocks/ 

## Creating a task
**1. Start with the create a task block**
-You can use the green text string block to fill in any missing info you want to put in. There is also a new block that in the text section where you can input it for more specific parts of the date. You would then use more string text blocks to fill in that information.

2. Add a task name description and then after adding the due dates second block with the month day and year.

## Assign a Task
- Here you will just re-enter what the task is and who you would like to be working on it through putting a name for the user.

## Set a Dependency 
- Connect this block to the past two blocks if you want to set a task within the task.

## Updating the Task Status
1. Connect this block to the current iteration if you would like to update a task status
- Here you identify the task you want to update by putting the name and then you are able to change the status by typing in whether it is Done, Needs Attention or to cut it.
