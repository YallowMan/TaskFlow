## Group Members: Carlos Garcia, Emma Harper, Emily Nguyen, Sofia Bejerano

## Motivation
Creating a effective task management system is crucial for personal and professional success. Simplify the sometimes overwhelming process of organizing, prioritizing and tracking tasks.

## Description of Project
Transform the way that tasks are managed with an intuitive block based language. Allows users to create, assign, and track tasks effortlessly. TaskFlow eliminates the need for complex syntax and technical expertise, making it suitable for users of all skill levels.

### How the Project relates to parsing, interpretation and compilation
In the context of the task management DSL, parsing would involve breaking down the user's input into individual commands, identifying the keywords, parameters, and relationships between them. The interpreter would interpret each command and perform the corresponding actions within the task management system. For example, creating a task, assigning it to an individual or team, setting dependencies, updating task status, filtering and sorting tasks, and setting reminders. Compilation could involve optimizing the commands and generating code that directly interacts with the task management system's underlying data structures and APIs.

## Instructions
### Download Datagrip
- [Database Manager SQL](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/)
- This will have the SQL type of IDE in which you can mess around with mySQL to run different queries that are given through the blocks to manage our tasks.

### Generate a SQL Query 
- https://yallowman.github.io/TaskFlow/testingstuffwilldeletelater/index.html
- Use Interface to create and build queries to task manage.
- Generate the code by pressing the Generate Code button, which will give a SQL query.
- Select and Copy the query to clipboard

### Run the query in the Datagrip IDE
- Open up the database file and then create a console.
- Use said console by inserting your Query
